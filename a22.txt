linear equations
    coefficients * variables added together give a constant
    in two variables is a straight line

linear system
    system of linear equations
    a collection of linear equations that must all be true at the same time 

        {x-y=0
        {x+y=1
            the solution is where they meet
            their intesection is the solution to the system
            satisifies all the equations
                provides a point for all of them
    
        {x+y=3
        {y-x=5
            solved by (-1,4)
                -1+4    = 3
                4--1    = 5

        general form
            form of a linear system system in n variables with m equations

                a_1_1 x_1 + a_1_2 x_2 + ... + a_1 n * n = b_1
                a_2_1 x_1 + a_2_2 x_2 + ... + a_2 n * n = b_1
                                        ...
                a_m_1 x_1 + a_m_2 x_2 + ... + a_m n * n = b_1          

                a_ij = the coefficient of x_j in row i

        ex:
            solve ax=b
                depends on wether a and b are 0 or not
                    if a==0
                        if b==0
                            no solutions
                        else
                            infinite solutions
                    else
                        x=b/a, one unique solution 

        ex:
            solve   x+y=1
                      y=2
                plug y=2 the above equation:    x+2=1
                solve for x:                     x=-1

                therefore (-1,2) is a solution for the system
                plugging in isnt algorithmic so thats bad

        ex:
            solve   x +z=1
                     y+z=2

                infinitely many solutions
                    any value of z will be a solution
                
                x=1-z
                y=2-z
                z=0+z


                [x    [1    [-1 
                 y  =  2  +  -1 z
                 z]    0]     1]

                z is a parameter of the equation
                    every value of z will give a solution to the system

augmented matrices
    a way to represent a linear system as a matrix of numbers

        1x+2y=3    <==>     [ 1 2 | 3 ]
        4x+59=6             [ 4 5 | 6 ]

    each variable becomes a column
    equal sign becomes a vertical bar
    constants on the right hand side of the vertical bar

elementary row operations
    type1
        interchange two equations
        does not change the equations at all - exact same set of solutions
    type2
        multiply an equation by a nonzero number
        a_i1 x_1 + ... a_in x_n = bi
        this changes the number past the bar
    type3
        add a multiple of one equation to a different
    solving systems using elementary row oprtations
        a row of zeroes means that column cant be solved for
            means that variable is actually a parameter
    can manipulate matricies
        attempts to simplify matrices
        easy to find general solutions
        unique simplest form 

row echelon matrix
    row echelon form
        any rows of all 0s are at the bottom
        the first nonzero entry of each row is a 1
            called the leading 1 or the pivot
        it kinda just looks like a staircase
        each leading 1 is to the right of the one above it

    reduced row echelon form
        same rules as ref with an addition
        the cilumn of each leading 1 must contain only 0s except for the leading 1

    all rref are ref
        reverse is not necessarily true

    same possibilitis as ax=b <=> [a|b]
        if a==0
            if b==0
                no solutions
            else
                infinite solutions
        else
            x=b/a, one unique solution

    columns without leading 1s become parameters
        each parameter of a solution creations a basic solution

rref algorithms
    silly
        1   check if rref
        2   fix rule breaking entries
        3   go to 1
    
    gaussian
        1   if matrix is entirely 0s stop
        2   find first column from left with a non0 and move the row contaning it to the top position (call the non0 a)
        3   multiple the new top row by 1/a to create a leading 1
        4   subtracting multiples of that row from rows below it, clear the column of the leading 1
        5   repeat 1-4 on the remaning rows

homogenous systems
    always have a solution
        this is called the trivial solution
     as a matrix         as a system of linear equations
    [ * * * | 0 ]       { a_11 x1 + ... + a_1n x_n = 0
    [ * * * | 0 ]       {           ...
    [ * * * | 0 ]       { a_n1 x1 + ... + a_nn x_n = 0

    solving a system via a homogenous system
        to find a general solution set the constants to 0
        to find a particular solution set the parameter to 0

    every solution is a linear combination

linear combination
    a linear combination of a collection of vectors is a vector of the form
        v = a_1 v_1 + ... + a_n v_n
        vector = vector*number + vector*number ...
    youre just combining the vectors

rows and columns
    ij
    a_ij is the ith row and the jth column

matrix addition
    must be same size (n by k)
        not all matrices can be added together
    you ad the corresponding entries in each matrix

scaling a matrix
    also called multiplying by a scalar
    k is a real number
    A = [a_ij]
    kA = [ka_ij]

transposition
    rotating it
        you swap the rows and the columns
        reflecting across the diagnal (square matrices)
    A^T for A = a_ij = a_ji

    (A+B)^T = A^T + B^T 

vectors
    what is a vector R^n
        n*1 matrix
            n rows and 1 column
        coordinates
            origin is at [0,0,...,0]

linear systems as equations of vectors
    each column (variable) is a vector
        can name x_1 x_2
    linear systems are vectors

matrix vector multiplication
    multiply the columns of the matrix by the rows of the vector

homogenous decomposition
    every solutiuon ax=b has the form x=x_0 + x_p
        x_0 is a solution of the homogenous system
        x_p is a particular solution

matrix matrix multiplication
    each row of matrix A * ceach column of matrix b
    size
        n*k k*l = n*l
        2*3 3*2 = 2*2

        for ij
             n
            ---
            \   a_ik b_bkj 
            /
            ---
            k=1
    not commutative

    a11 a12 a13         b11 b12
    a21 a22 a23         b21 b22
                        b31 b32
        
    a11*b11 + a12*b21 + a13 * b31       a11*b12 + a12*b22 + a13*b32
    a21*b11 + a21*b22 + a23 * b31       a21*b12 + a21*b22 + a23*b32

identity matrix
    n*n = I_n
    multiplying any matrix by the identity matrix will return the initial matrix
    I_n * A = A for any A

    just has 1s along the diagonal and all 0s 

    [1   0   0]
    [0   1   0]
    [0   0   1]

inverses
    A = n*n matrix
    B is an inverse for A if 
        AB = BA = I_n

    to invert a matrix set its constants to the identity matrix for its size
    then try get the matrix itself to look like the identity matrix and whats left as the constants is the inverse

    matrix inversion algorithm
        1   set up augmented system [A|I_n]
        2   apply gaussian algorithm to the system to obtain [R|A'] with R=RREF(A)
        3   if R = I_n then A^-1 = A'
        4   if R != I_n then A is not invertable
    
elementary matrices 
    a matrix that can be obtained from the identity matrix by a single row operation
    a matrix is invertible iff it is the product of elementary matrices

linear transformations
    a linear transformation is a function T: R^n -> R^k such that
        T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y)
        T(ax) = aT(x)
    
    two important examples
        T(x) = λx
            stretch all by a fator of λ
        T_A (X) = Ax
            multiplication by a matrix A

eigenvalues and eigenvectors
    an eigenvalue of A is a number λ such that
        Ax = λx
    for a nonzero vector x

    eigen=own/belong
        particular for each matrix
    
    come in pairs
        every eigenvector A has a corresponding eigenvalue λ

    how to find eigenvalues
        Ax = λx = (λI) x <=> (λIx)-Ax = 0 <=> (λI-A)x = 0

        solve det(λI-A) = 0
    
    how to find eigenvectors
        solve homogenous system (λI-A)x = 0
            homogenous so always will have a solution
            λI-A is not invertible
                means has a parameter
                    has a nontrivial solution

    the characteristic polynomial of A
        C(λ) = det(λI-A)

    let us calculate large powers

determinants
    det a   b   =   ad-bc
        c   d

    det(abcd) = 0 <=> (abcd) is not invertable

    if A = [a], then det(a) = a
    if a A has a r/c of all 0s then det(A) = 0
    if two distinct rows or clumns are interchange then the result's determinant is -det(A)
    if a r/c of A is mulitiplied by a constant u, ... is u det(A)
    if two distinct rows or columns of A are identical then det(A)=0
    if a multiple of one r/c of A is added to a different r/c ... is det(A)
    if A is square, then det(A^T) = det(A)
    

subspace
    subspaces of R^n
        zero vector 0 isin U
        if x isin U then x+y isin U
        if x isin U then ax isin U for every real number a
