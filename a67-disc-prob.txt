experiment
    a procedure that yields one of a given set of outcomes

sample space
    set of possible outcomes from an experiment
    
    can be countably infinite
        not uncountably infinite

    represented by S

event
    subset of sample space

probability distrobution
    function that maps from a sample space to R 

    Sum p(s) = 1
    s in S

    p(s) is the probability of getting s from S in an experiment

uniform distrobution
    all outcomes are equally likely

probability of events
    the probability of an event E is the sum of probabilities of the outcomes in each

    p(E) = Sum p(s)
          s in E 
    
probability of complements of events
    S = E union Ebar
    1-Ebar = E

conditional probability
    probability of E if F has occurred

    p(E|F) = p(E intersect F)/p(F)

independence
    two events E and F are independant iff
        p(E intersect F) = p(E) * p(F)
    means they dont impact eachother

    P(E|F) = P(E)

bernoulli trials and binomial distribution
    an experiment exists
        2 possible outcomes p and q 
        experiment is done n times
        each attempt is called a bernoulli trial
        each trial is mutually independant
    
    to find the probability of k successes in n trials
        C(n, k) k successes
        probability of each is p^k q^n-k

        so the probability of k successes in n trials is 
        C(n,k) p^k q^n-k

random variable
    rv 
    a function from the sample space of an experiment to R
    
    not variable
        poor name
    upper case letter convention
    standard function notation

distribution
    let S be a sample space
    ..  p ..   probability distribution on S
    ..  X ..   RV                       ..

    p(X=r) is the probability that X(s) equals r 
        sum of all probabilities p(s) over all outcomes s with X(s) = r

expected value
    mean
    weighted average
    expectation

    undefined if S is infinite
    
      Sum (p(s) * X(s))
    s in S
