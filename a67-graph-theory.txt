graph
    set of nodes and edges

    graph
        G = (V, E)
    edge
        e = (u, v)

        connects two nodes
            not directional unless otherwise stated
        (u, v) = (v, u)
            an edge connecting a node to itself is a loop

        u and v are nodes, the endpoints of e
            adjacent in G
            neighbours in G

        e is in E

        e is incident with u and v
            touching?
            shares a node?
    
    nodes
        letters
        v is in V

        neightbourhood of v
            N(v) = { u in V | (v, u) in E}
                all points that share an edge

        degree of v
            deg(v) = |N(v)|
            number of edges that are incident with v
                if its incident with an edge it means there is another node
        
            diagraphs
                in-degree
                    edges going into node
                out-degree
                    edges going out of node


    diagraph - directional graph
        graph where edges are directional
    
    multigraph
        multiple edges can connect the same pair of nodes
        
        not assumed unless otherwise stated
    
    drawn as dots and lines
        house graph

handshaking theorem
    let G = (V, E) be a graph

    2 * |E| = Sum   deg(v)
             v in V

    twice the number of edges is equal to the sum of the nodes' degrees

    each edge contributes 2 to the sum of the degree of nodes

complete graphs
    let G = (V, E) be a graph
    
    G is complete if there is an edge connecting every node

    denoted by K_n

    ex  O - O
        | /
        O

cycles
    for n >= 3 consider the graph G = (V, E)
        V = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}
        E = {(v_1,v_2), (v_2,v_3), ..., (v_{n-1},v_n), (v_n,v_1)}

        |V| = |E| = n

        closed

        ex  O - O
            |   |
            O - O

paths
    for n > 0 consider the graph G = (V, E)
        V = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}
        E = {(v_1,v_2), (v_2,v_3), ..., (v_{n-1},v_n), (v_n,v_1)}
    

    open

    ex  O - O
        |
        O - O 

bipartite graph
    let G = (V, E) be a graph
        V can be partitioned into subsets V1 and V2

        for every pair of nodes in V (u, v)
            (u,v) is in E iff they do not share a subset

    complete bipartite
        every node in v1 is adjacent to every node in v2

        denoted by |V1| = m and |V2| = n
            K_{m, n}

subgraphs
    G = (V, E)          H = (W, F)
    H is a subgraph of G iff w is a subset of V and F is a subset of E
        every element of W is in V and every element of F is in E
    
    proper subgraph
        G != H

induced subgraphs
    G = (V, E)          W is a nonempty subset of V
        the subgraph induced by W is H = (W, F)
            F contains an edge in E iff both endpoints are in W

    to construct
        G = (V, E)
        Remove all edges that are incident with nodes not in W
        Remove all nodes not in W

isomorphic graphs
    2 graphs..
        G1 = (V1, E1)
        G2 = (V2, E2)
    ..are isomorphic iff theres a 1to1 and onto function f 
    from V1 to V2 such that
        for every pair of nodes (u, v) in V1
            (u, v) in E1 <=> (f(u), f(v)) in E2

    the function f is an isomorphism

    relabling the nodes of G1 to create G2

    a 1to1 and onto functions are called a bijection
        isomorphisms are bijections
    
    the inverse of a bijection is also a bijection

    edges are preserved if when f is applied to
    the endpoints of an edge E1
        the resulting endpoints are the edge E2

path in a graph
    n = nonnegative integer
    G = (V, E)
    u and v = nodes in V

    sequence of edges

connectivity
    connected iff theres a path between any distinct pair of nodes

    can not draw a line through it without cutting through an edge

    connected component
        connected subgraph that is not a proper subgraph
