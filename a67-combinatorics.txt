product rule
    if a procedure can be broken down into 2 task with n_1 and n_2 ways to do each one, there are n_1*n_2 ways to do the task

    n_1 * n_2 * ... * n_m

sum rule
    a task can be done in n_1 OR n_2 ways (independant) then you have n_1 + n_2 ways of doing the task

inclusion exclusion principle
    subtraction rule
    if a task can be done in n_1 or n_2 ways, add n_1 and n_2 but subtract the common ways

division rule
    there are n/d ways to do a task if it can be carried out in n ways
    for every way w, there are d of the n ways

tree diagram
    a tree consists of a node called the root
        each node other than the root can have branches to other nodes
        a node that does not branch into another node is a leaf

pigeonhole principle
    php
    k+1 or more objects are placed into k boxes
        at least one box contains two or more objects

permutation
    order matters

    sometimes called/pronounced
        from n sample r
        nPr
        
    0 <= r <= n

    P(n,r) = C(n,r) * r!

    no repetition of elements
    
        P(n,r)=n!/(n-r)!

                    n!
        P(n,r) = --------
                  (n-r)!
    
    with repetition of the elements
        
        P(n,r)=n^r

                  r
        P(n,r) = n

    indistinguishable objects
        n!/(n_1! * n_2! * ... * n_k!)



combination
    order does not matter


    n choose r
    nCr
    binomial coefficient

    without repetition of elements

        C(n,r) = C(n,n-r)

        C(n,r)=n!/(r!*(n-r)!)

                    n!
        C(n,r) = -------------
                r! * (n-r)!

    with repetition of elements

        C(n,r) is for distinct objects, think as an arragement of |'s and O's (bars and stars theorem)

        C(n+r-1, r) = (n+r-1)!/(r! * (n-1)!)

                        (n+r-1)!
        C(n+r-1, r) = --------------
                       r! * (n-1)!
